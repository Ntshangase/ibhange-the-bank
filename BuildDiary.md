# Ibhange-the-Bank

the name `ibhange` is an isiZulu word for bank.
Here i aim to document my build journey.

### Pre- build
This is a Basalt fullstack takehome test, it seems this was originally confidential and they have released it to the public as it is now available on their public repo. 
In this build i will use `react` as i'm most familiar with it and i think this will help me improve my skills in react, i'm also trying to limit the amount of new technologies i'm learning so that i can alteast master one/two and be highly productive with them.
this is suppose to be a one-week assignment. I don't know if that will be enough for me to complete since i have a 2test but if i can break it down i think that will work for me more because it looks easy the only thing which i think i could spend some time in is the API specifications. 


###Task breakdown
- build an budget tracking application 
- assume only one user of the application.
- allow and reflect transactions.
